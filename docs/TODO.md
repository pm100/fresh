### Priority 3: Virtual Buffers & Advanced Plugin UIs

**Goal:** Enable plugins to create rich UIs (Magit-style git interface, grep results, undo tree visualization) following Emacs' special buffer philosophy.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ BufferMode system implemented (keybindings, inheritance, read-only flag)
- ✅ TextProperty system implemented (metadata embedding in text ranges)
- ✅ Plugin API commands defined (CreateVirtualBuffer, SetContent, etc.)
- ❌ BufferKind enum not yet implemented (file vs virtual distinction)
- ❌ TypeScript ops for virtual buffers not exposed

#### Remaining Infrastructure Tasks

- [ ] **BufferKind Enum**
  - Add `BufferKind::File { path }` vs `BufferKind::Virtual { name, mode }`
  - Virtual buffers skip file I/O, dirty-checking, LSP notifications
  - `*Name*` convention signals special buffer (Emacs style)

- [ ] **TypeScript Virtual Buffer Ops**
  - `op_fresh_create_virtual_buffer(name, mode, read_only)`
  - `op_fresh_create_virtual_buffer_in_split(name, mode, entries, ratio, ...)`
  - `op_fresh_set_virtual_buffer_content(buffer_id, entries)`
  - `op_fresh_get_text_properties_at_cursor(buffer_id)`
  - `op_fresh_define_mode(name, config)`

- [ ] **Next-Error Navigation Pattern**
  - Global `next-error` / `previous-error` commands (M-g n / M-g p)
  - Plugin API: `editor.set_next_error_source(buf_id, callback)`
  - Navigation works from any buffer (jumps to source location)

- [ ] **Revert Buffer Mechanism**
  - `revert-buffer` command (g in special mode) calls buffer's revert function
  - Plugin API: `editor.set_revert_function(buf_id, callback)`

#### Example Plugin: Diagnostics Panel (TypeScript) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

- [x] Selection marker for current diagnostic
- [x] Summary footer with error/warning counts
- [ ] Filter by severity (errors only, warnings only, all)
- [ ] Auto-refresh on diagnostic updates
- [ ] Integrate with next-error navigation

### Priority 6: Unified Event System

**Goal**: Create a coherent event architecture unifying hooks, control events, and script control mode.

#### Phase 1: Editor Emits Control Events
- [ ] Add `EventBroadcaster` to Editor
- [ ] Emit FileOpened, FileSaved, FileClosed events
- [ ] Emit LspStatusChanged, DiagnosticsUpdated events
- [ ] Emit PopupShown/Hidden, CompletionReceived events

#### Phase 2: Plugin Event API

## Technical Debt & Refactoring

### Unified Line Cache Architecture (High Priority)

**Problem**: Line number ↔ byte offset conversions are a major performance bottleneck.

**Solution**: Unify line tracking into the existing IntervalTree marker system. Lines are intervals between newlines, reusing lazy delta propagation for O(log N) edits.

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Phase 1: Extend IntervalTree with `MarkerType` enum and line marker methods
- [ ] Phase 2: Add `line_to_byte` / `byte_to_line` to unified tree
- [ ] Phase 3: Migrate `lsp_position_to_byte` to use new system
- [ ] Phase 4: Remove `LineCache` struct and eager update logic
- [ ] Phase 5: Add lazy line marker rescanning for edits with newlines
- [ ] Phase 6: Implement viewport-based line population strategy
- [ ] Phase 7: Benchmark with large files (1GB+) and many diagnostics (10k+)

### Line Wrapping Refactoring
- [ ] Unify wrapping and no-wrapping code paths
- [ ] Move cursor position calculation into rendering traversal
- [ ] Fix style preservation during wrapping

### Code Organization
- [ ] Create BufferView abstraction
- [ ] Extract multi-cursor operations
- [ ] Split large modules (editor.rs)

### Split View Improvements

**Current Status**: Basic split view implemented with Emacs-style shared buffers. Each split has independent cursors and viewports, edits are synchronized.

**Remaining Work**:
- [ ] Splitting a split that already has minimal size (1-2 lines)
- [ ] Nested splits (3+ levels deep) maintain correct hierarchy
- [ ] Rapid split/close operations don't leak memory
- [ ] Resizing terminal window redistributes space proportionally

### Test Infrastructure
- [ ] TypeScript plugin testing infrastructure (unit tests, mocking, test helpers)
- [ ] Fix async file loading in test harness
- [ ] Fix BIG.txt generation timing for scrolling tests
- [ ] Add more E2E tests for complex workflows
- [ ] Performance regression tests

---

## Completed Work (Summary)

### TypeScript Plugin System Migration
Full migration from Lua to TypeScript as the sole plugin runtime:
- Embedded Deno Core (V8 engine) with native ops
- Async/await support via native Promises
- TypeScriptPluginManager with load/unload/reload/hot-reload
- Event/hook system (editor.on/off with emit infrastructure)
- Production plugins (git-grep, git-find-file, todo-highlighter, etc.)
- Complete removal of mlua and all Lua code

### Plugin Thread Architecture (CRITICAL - Required for Async Ops)

**Problem**: Current `run_hook_blocking()` creates a new tokio runtime for each hook call. When plugins call async ops (like `spawnProcess`), the runtime is destroyed after the hook returns, orphaning pending async work and causing hangs.

**Solution**: Dedicated thread for TypeScript plugin execution with message passing.

**Architecture**:
```
Main Thread (UI)                    Plugin Thread
     │                                    │
     ├─────── HookRequest ──────────────>│
     │        (hook_name, args)           │
     │                                    ├── JsRuntime lives here (not Send/Sync)
     │                                    ├── Persistent tokio runtime
     │                                    ├── Executes JS/TS code
     │                                    ├── Drives async ops to completion
     │                                    │
     │<─────── PluginCommand ────────────┤
     │         (setPromptSuggestions,     │
     │          setStatus, etc.)          │
     │                                    │
```

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Phase 1: Create PluginThread struct
  - Owns JsRuntime and tokio Runtime
  - Spawned on dedicated thread at editor startup
  - Event loop: receive requests, execute, send results

- [ ] Phase 2: Define message types
  - `HookRequest { hook_name, args, response_channel }`
  - `ActionRequest { action_name, response_channel }`
  - `LoadPluginRequest { path }`
  - `ShutdownRequest`

- [ ] Phase 3: Refactor TypeScriptPluginManager
  - Remove `run_hook_blocking()` and other `*_blocking()` methods
  - Replace with async message sending to plugin thread
  - `run_hook()` becomes fire-and-forget (results via PluginCommand channel)

- [ ] Phase 4: Update Editor integration
  - Editor calls `ts_manager.send_hook(name, args)` (non-blocking)
  - Plugin thread executes hook asynchronously
  - Results come back via existing `PluginCommand` channel
  - `process_async_messages()` already handles these

- [ ] Phase 5: Handle plugin loading
  - `load_plugin()` sends request to plugin thread
  - Blocks on response (only during startup)
  - Or: make plugin loading fully async

**Benefits**:
- Complete isolation: Plugins can't block UI thread
- Stable async runtime: Single tokio runtime for all async ops
- Natural async model: Plugins use async/await without restrictions
- No race conditions: Sequential execution within plugin thread
- Matches industry standard: Similar to VSCode's Extension Host

**Files to modify**:
- `src/ts_runtime.rs`: Extract runtime into PluginThread, add message passing
- `src/editor.rs`: Update hook calls to be non-blocking
- `src/plugin_api.rs`: May need adjustments for thread safety

### Menu Bar System

- Deferred document open (queue commands until init completes)
- Diagnostics, completion, go-to-definition, rename refactoring
- Progress notifications, window messages, UTF-16 position encoding
- CPU optimization (eliminated busy-wait loop)

### Search & Replace
Streaming search on GB+ files, regex support, interactive query-replace, search in selection, search history.

### Plugin Infrastructure
BufferMode system (keybindings with inheritance), TextProperty system (metadata embedding), hook-based prompt API, command registration, async process spawning.

### Performance Optimizations
ChunkTree, IntervalTree marker system (O(log n)), viewport-based rendering, eliminated expensive buffer.to_string() calls.

### UI & Layout
Split views (horizontal/vertical with shared buffers), file explorer (lazy loading, gitignore, create/delete), command palette, themes, scrollbars, tab bar.

### Core Editing
Multi-cursor editing, unlimited undo/redo, position history navigation, auto-indent (tree-sitter based), large file support (1GB+).
